Choose a suitable chaotic map: There are various chaotic maps available, such as Logistic map, Henon map, and Lorenz system. Select one based on its properties and suitability for encryption.

Generate encryption keys: Use the chaotic map to generate a sequence of random numbers, which will serve as the encryption keys. These keys should be unpredictable and have a large key space to enhance security.

Pixel scrambling: Apply a pixel scrambling technique to shuffle the image pixels based on the generated encryption keys. This process ensures that the original image information is concealed and distributed across the image.

Diffusion: Apply a diffusion operation to spread the pixel values across the entire image. This step enhances the encryption strength by making it difficult to extract any meaningful information from localized regions.

Repeat the process: Repeat the pixel scrambling and diffusion steps multiple times to increase the complexity and security of the encryption.

Store or transmit the encrypted image: Once the encryption process is complete, you can store or transmit the encrypted image, which can only be decrypted using the same encryption keys and reverse operations.

Keep in mind that image encryption using chaos maps is just one of many encryption techniques available. It is important to assess the security requirements of your application and consider other encryption algorithms and methods to ensure robust protection.
